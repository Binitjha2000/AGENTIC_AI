# Steps to Create a Reddit App:
# Log in to Reddit:
# Go to Reddit's App Preferences.
# Create a new app:
# Scroll down to "Developed Applications" â†’ Click "Create App".
# App Type: Choose "script" (since this is for personal use).
# Name: Give your app a meaningful name (e.g., "Crowd Helper Bot").
# Redirect URI: Set it to http://localhost:8000 (you donâ€™t need this for scripts, but Reddit requires a value).
# Click "Create App".
# Get Your Credentials:
# After creating, youâ€™ll see a section with:
# Client ID (Found under "personal use script").
# Client Secret (Found under "secret").
# User Agent (Any descriptive name like "myRedditBot:v1.0 (by u/YourRedditUsername)").
